		<p><font size="3"> <br><br>At JSPM, A virtual classroom allows learners to attend a class from any campus; and the professor/Trainer anywhere in the world with the <br>aim to provide a learning experience that is similar to a real classroom. 
			<br>In JSPM the following programs are arranged using Virtual Class rooms<br><br>
			 1) Additional sharing of the best faculty members amongst JSPM institutes.<br><br>
             2) Live Video lectures of specialists within / outside the University and from industries.<br><br>
             3) This is highly influential for the lectures of professors from foreign countries. <br><br><br>This enables students and researchers to
               interact with such world class faculties without any additional expenses.<br><br>4) It helps in soft skill development and job interviews from college.<br><br> 5) High level of meetings with various groups.
               A virtual classroom enables to bring learners from around the world together online in highly interactive virtual classes while greatly reducing the travel, time, and expense of on-site teaching/training programs.<br><br>
			   It can be used as a solution for live delivery and interaction that addresses the entire process of creating and managing JSPM’s teaching-learning process. <br><br>
			   It facilitates instructor and student in teaching-learning events, such as a seminar, online discussion or a live training for employees in company. <br><br>
			   As in traditional classroom, there are professor and fellow learners present with the student; we have many participants present in virtual classroom. <br><br>
			  They can talk with each other as in the traditional classroom via chat. Similarly presenter uses whiteboard, gives notes/resources, and gives presentation as given in traditional one.<br><br>
			   Thus, virtual classroom can be visualized as a classroom where a lecture or session is conducted using Internet.<br><br></p></font>
		<br><br><p align="left"><font size="4">Advantages of Virtual Classroom in JSPM :</font></p><br>
         <p>Following are some of the advantages of Virtual classroom over traditional classroom model:</p>
			
			<br><br><p align="left"><font size="4">Removal of geographical barriers (Anywhere learning):</font></p><br>
         <p>A virtual classroom allows learners and teachers to attend a single live training session from any place in the world, provided they have a computer and Internet connection.</p>
			<br><br><p align="left"><font size="4">Sessions can be recorded:</font></p><br>
         <p>If learners miss a traditional classroom-based training session, they have very little opportunity to engage in the learning experience that took place.<br>
			 A virtual classroom has a facility to record the session so learners or teachers can replay it afterwards.<br>
			 Teachers also get an opportunity to review their own or their colleagues’ performance.</p>
			
			<br><br><p align="left"><font size="4">Quicker to organize:</font></p><br>
         <p>Training can be organized more quickly than traditional classroom-based training. <br>
			 Classrooms and projectors do not need to be reserved; materials do not need to be distributed.<br>
			 The sessions are easier to schedule or reschedule since attendees will not be traveling to the venue of the session.</p>
			
			<br><br><p align="left"><font size="4">One to one communication:</font></p><br>
         <p>In a virtual classroom environment, learners can talk to the teacher and to each other, and although this communication is not as rich in a traditional classroom, it still can help learners, since it is one to one. <br>
			 Due to these advantages, concept of virtual classroom is getting very popular. Since it allows learners to attend sessions from anywhere in world, it is very useful for distant learners and for peoples who cannot meet face to face because of lack of time. <br>
			 Though it gives lots of advantages, it has some pitfalls also.
			 Following section describes some limitations of virtual classroom.</p>
			<br><br><p align="left"><font size="4">Overall Approach:</font></p>
         <br><br><p>Our approach is to build a system that would facilitate conducting seminars on Internet for participants from anywhere in world.<br>
			 Users can get many advantages by using virtual classroom. He can save a lot of time by using the virtual classroom to attend the session.<br>
			 Our virtual classroom will have two types of users, as presenter and participant.<br>
			 When a user enters in the virtual classroom, he will be asked whether he want to join the classroom as presenter or participant. <br>
			 Presenter is the one who conducts the session, and participant is the one who attends the session. <br>
			 Presenter when enters the classroom, he can also perform administrative functionalities. The users of virtual classroom (presenter and participant) has different interface of the classroom, when they enter in the classroom.<br>
			 Depending on the user type, the features of the classroom will be different for Presenter and Participant.</p>
